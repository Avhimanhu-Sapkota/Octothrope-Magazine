# Octothrope Magazine

Octothrope Magazine is a front-end based website project, where you can look at the magazine articles and enjoy reading them. It contains articles from various websites, whose link will be displayed in the end of the article. 
This website uses HTML and CSS using Bootstrap framework. It also has some basic Javascript code included. Basically, it is a project based on the assignment of Leeds Beckett University for Level 4 students to show off knowledges and skills that I have learned in the curriculum.
This website has been hosted, however it might not be available if the server has deleted the contents as it is my college's server. Link: http://c7202323.thebritishcollege.org/Project/index.html
