        <h2>Samsung Galaxy Fold</h2>
        <!--Contents has been copied from https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18231249/samsung-galaxy-fold-folding-phone-features-screen-photos-size-announcement-->
        <p>Samsung first teased its foldable phone back in November, and at the company’s Galaxy Unpacked event today,
           it’s further detailing its foldable plans. Samsung’s foldable now has a name, the Samsung Galaxy Fold,
           and the company is revealing more about what this unique smartphone can do. Samsung is planning to launch
           the Galaxy Fold on April 26th, starting at $1,980, through AT&T and T-Mobile in the US, with a free pair of
           Samsung’s new wireless earbuds. There will be both an LTE and 5G version of the Galaxy Fold, and Samsung is 
           even planning on launching the device in Europe on May 3rd, starting at 2,000 euros. 
        </p>

        <h3>Specifications</h3>

        <p>Samsung is using a new 7.3-inch Infinity Flex Display that allows the phone itself to have a tablet-sized
          screen that can be folded to fit into a pocket. The main display is QXGA+ resolution (4.2:3), and when it’s
          folded, a smaller 4.6-inch HD+ (12:9) display is used for the phone mode. Samsung is using 512GB of
          Universal Flash Storage 3.0 (eUFS) for fast speeds, alongside a Qualcomm 7nm octa-core processor and
          12GB of RAM. Samsung has even built two batteries for its Galaxy Fold, that are separated by the fold
          but combined in the Android operating system to represent a total of 4,380 mAh.
         </p>

        <h3>Multi-tasking Feature</h3>

        <p>Samsung is allowing the Galaxy Fold to run three apps at once on this Android device, and it’s using an
           app continuity system to adjust these apps when you move between tablet and phone modes. Apps like WhatsApp,
           Microsoft Office, and YouTube have all been optimized for the new display and modes, and Samsung has been
           working with Google to ensure Android 9 Pie fully supports this display.
