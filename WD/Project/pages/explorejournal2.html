                        The world was once, for many of us, a huge and daunting labyrinth; a difficult, expensive challenge to navigate, and a path 
                        best travelled with friends in tow. You had to be good at map-reading, for one, with the ability to overcome language barriers.
                         Getting around was simply harder.
                        <br><br>
                        That’s changed considerably, and an ever-increasing number of us are these days setting off on adventures alone. Is it just 
                        that Google can now steer even the most directionally challenged among us to our next location, or translate words from any 
                        dialect back and forth?
                        <br><br>
                        Is it that more of us are single, and staying single, than ever before? Are we now by nature too impatient to wait for a 
                        suitable companion to show up?
                        <br><br>
                        Telegraph Travel spoke to a variety of tour operators to examine the rising trend of going it alone, to see how it is impacting
                         everything from hotel bookings and Airbnbs, to cruises and British cottage breaks.
                </p>
                
                <h4>What sort of travellers are going solo?</h4>
                
                <p style="font-family:Cambria;font-size:1.3vw;text-align: justify;">
                        It’s a mixed bag, now more than ever.
                        <br><br>
                        As far as younger travellers go, according to data from the Abta, almost one in eight 18-24 year olds reported
                         going on a holiday by themselves in 2017. In 2011, this question was asked to 15-24 year olds and the figure was 
                         just 4.5 per cent.
                        <br><br>
                        According to Hostelworld, the number of solo bookings made by Britons has increased 60 per cent over the past three 
                        years, the highest rise globally.
                        <br><br>
                        Singles holiday operator Just You says the age of their clientele ranges from 21 to 90, but averages out at 
                        the 55+ age group.
                        <br><br>
                        What does appear to be consistent, however, is that women are much more likely to travel alone than men, and that’s
                         only rising.
                        <br><br>
                        Hitwise says that since January, the audiences driving searches for solo travel have been women (55 per cent of them)
                         aged between 25-34 years old and living in London.
                         <br><br>
                         Unique Home Stays says that in 2015, the average age of its solo traveller was 46, made up of 22 per cent men and 78 
                         per cent women. In 2017, the average age was 47, with 84 per cent being female, and only 16 per cent being male.
                         <br><br>
                        Writing for The Telegraph earlier this year about her decision to set off alone, Suzanne Joinson remarked: “In the past,
                         the idea of women going on solo adventures was considered ‘brave’, ‘eccentric’ or ‘risky’. But [there has since] been a
                          huge shift in attitude.
                        <br><br>
                        “A hike into the wilderness is what I need; it will be a balm for my rotten, digitally toxic soul. But taking family with
                         me would just be more logistics to contend with and if I went with a friend we’d inevitably end up stopping at a pub, 
                         eating pie, sipping prosecco and talking rubbish, which is the opposite of what I am looking for. I need peace. I need quiet.
                          And most of all, I really, really need to be alone.”
                </p>

                <h4>Voyaging alone: is it good for you?</h4>

                <p style="font-family:Cambria;font-size:1.3vw;text-align: justify;">
                        Psychotherapist Tony Ingham was one of the many we asked in his field who came back with a resounding yes. 
                        It provides a break from monotony, he explains, builds confidence and exposes you to people and places you’d 
                        otherwise never cross. But most of us know this.
                        <br><br>
                        Perhaps one of the most overlooked downsides however, are the very real re-entry blues.
                        <br><br>
                        “Frequently I work with people who have had the most exceptional experience on their travels and find the
                         return home disappointing,” he says.
                        <br><br>
                        Naturally, going solo can be difficult for the less-social travellers among us. “More introverted people can
                         become anxious, and retreat into their shells,” Ingham confirms. But should they go for it anyway? Arguably.
                          A recent Booking.com survey found that a substantial 71 per cent of global travellers have had regrets over 
                          missed travel opportunities.
                        <br><br>
                        Generation Z (18-24 year olds) were found to be the most willing to face their travel anxieties head-on, with
                         two thirds managing to overcome their concerns. For many, that means setting off alone even if you’d rather have a friend.

                    <h4>What are the pitfalls of travelling solo</h4>

                <p style="font-family:Cambria;font-size:1.3vw;text-align: justify;">
                        When Lonely Planet quizzed more than 4,000 of its members this year, four out of five have either had or were
                         planning a solo trip. Disappointingly, a third of them said they’d felt disadvantaged by choosing to travel alone.
                          Half of them, for example, have had to pay a single person supplement as a result of going solo.
                        <br><br>
                        Telegraph Travel’s consumer expert Nick Trend explains: “The argument goes like this. Holidays are usually priced
                         per person based on two people sharing a twin or double room. When a single person books, many tour operators levy
                          an extra charge. They argue that they have to charge extra because singles are a less attractive commercial proposition
                           for them. Among other aspects, single travellers spend less money in the restaurant and bar than couples.”
                </p>

                <h4>A compromise?</h4>

                <p style="font-family:Cambria;font-size:1.3vw;text-align: justify;">
                        For those travelling solo by circumstance rather than choice, there is a middle way. Small group package tours
                         made up of strangers are proving themselves popular.
                        <br><br>
                        Mandy Appleyard, who wrote for Telegraph Travel about a trip to India, explains: “I am single, intrepid and a lover
                         of remote, long-haul exotic destinations. I don’t usually travel with close friends because, variously, they want 
                         to sleep on a sun lounger for a fortnight, won’t catch a flight longer than two hours or don’t want to travel where
                          vaccinations are required.
                        <br><br>
                        “As I grow older and less compromising, I’ve found it suits me to do small group holidays: there’s company if I want 
                        it (at dinner, I always do), but also the opportunity to be separate without offending anyone. There’s a strong chance
                         you’ll meet like-minded people, and for me the mix of the social and the solitary works well.”
                        <br><br>
                        Solo travel expert Gill Charlton agees, noting: “Some of the best holidays I’ve had have been those where I have set 
                        off on my own and travelled with strangers. Experience has shown me that I’ll find like-minded companions in any group.
                         Statistics tell us that one in four British adults has never married or is divorced or widowed. Add to these singletons
                          all those keen travellers whose partners either cannot or will not join them, and that’s a huge potential market.”
