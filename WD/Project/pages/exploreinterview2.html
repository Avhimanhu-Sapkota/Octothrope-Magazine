                        The flamboyant Yogeshwor Amatya has been a well-known figure in the Nepali soft-rock scene for the past two decades. In 1995,
                         he shot to fame as a singer with his song 'Jaba Sandhya Huncha', which he wrote as a teenager. Since then, he has produced 
                         albums like Karai Kara Le (in 1998) and Bastoo (in 2002), winning the hearts of Nepalis all over the world.
                </p>
                <p style="font-family:Cambria;font-size:1.3vw;text-align: justify;">
                        <strong> What is your daily routine like?</strong><br>
                        I am a very late riser. On most days, I wake up way past noon. Because I don't have a nine-to-five job as such,
                         I don't have a productive day planned out for me. After I get up, I head out of my house, without even brushing my teeth,
                          and have lunch with my friends. Then, my day picks up pace and I just go with the flow and see how everything unfolds.   
                </p>
                
                <p style="font-family:Cambria;font-size:1.3vw;text-align: justify;">
                       <strong> What else keeps you busy?</strong><br>
                        I keep myself busy with some Newari literature. My grandmother was extremely devoted to Nepali and Newari literature,
                         and that passion was passed on to me. And to do my bit to keep local literature alive, I have helped publish two Newari
                          dictionaries, the proceeds of which are donated to Nepal Bhasa Academy.
                </p>

                        <strong>How do you think your childhood helped shape you as a person?</strong><br>
                        Ever since I was a child, I have always been surrounded by creative, learned people. When I was young, my guru was Prem Raj Poudel,
                         who was the first editor of Gorkhapatra. People like Renchin Yonzon, who is the wife of the late Gopal Yonzon; the poet Bhim Darshan
                          Roka; the historian Satya Mohan Joshi; and the essayist Shankar Lamichhane have taught me a lot of things. My father, Bhuwaneshor Amatya,
                           was the first President of Nepal Chalchitra Sangha, and my mother, Lamu Amatya, was the first trained nurse in Nepal. And they both also 
                           had a huge influence on me. I think the influence of all these innovative people shaped me to be the person I am today. You can learn so much
                            from everyone around you, and I have always been blessed to be around the best minds.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family:Cambria;font-size:1.3vw;text-align: justify;">
                        <strong>Why did you not pursue gemology as a profession?</strong><br>
                        I think I had to give up one precious dream in order to pursue another. In order to pursue singing, 
                        I had to stop pursuing my interest in gems. But if given the chance, I would definitely pursue a serious
                         career in gemology. I love jewellery. I love getting down to the intricate detailing of jewellery designing;
                          it gives my soul satisfaction. Singing, however, was something that was just in me--all I need is a few pegs 
                          of whiskey and a guitar.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family:Cambria;font-size:1.3vw;text-align: justify;">
                       <strong> How did you stumble into the world of music?</strong><br>
                        I have no idea. When I was in school, I had wonderful teachers, like Mrs Melford, Rinchen Yonzon, and the legendary
                         Gopal Yonzon--all of whom I respect immensely, and who have taught me a great deal. I have always liked singing, but
                          I never thought it'd be something that people would associate me with.
                        
                </p>

                <p style="font-family:Cambria;font-size:1.3vw;text-align: justify;">
                        <strong>Do you write your own songs?</strong><br>
                        Yes, I do write my own songs. I wrote 'Jaba Sandya Huncha' when I was probably just 13 or 14 years old. You know how it 
                        is when you're young and in love--you have this passion, and you just put it to paper. It's been awhile that I have not 
                        written a song, though.

                       <strong> Do you have musical preferences?</strong><br>
                        I personally prefer soft rock. One of my favourite bands is Simon & Garfunkel. As for singers close to home,
                         I love the work of Bachchu Kailash, Deepak Kharel and Arun Thapa.

                        <strong>In reference to one of your famous songs, do you think it is okay for men to shed tears sometimes?</strong><br>
                        I am a big crier. I don't know if even my wife knows this, but I cry while listening to songs, and even while watching movies. 
                        It's made to seem that men are much tougher than women, but when the going gets tough, it's the women who are stronger and keep
                         a strong head. We men tend to break down and get lost. And I think it's absolutely okay to shed tears. I don't know how else to
                          cope with emotions.
                </p>

                       <strong> What are your other indulgences besides music?</strong><br>
                        I like cooking. I try to cook whenever I have the time. My another indulgence is fine single-malt whiskey. I love 
                        indulging in the best whiskeys from around the world. After all, what's life without drinking some good whiskey?
                </p>    

                <p style="font-family:Cambria;font-size:1.3vw;text-align: justify;">
                        <strong>We hear you are also a whisky connoisseur.</strong><br>
                        My children studied in Scotland, and while I was there during one of my trips, I had the opportunity to visit the
                         distilleries of Glenfiddich and Chivas Regal. When I visited the distillery, I had tears in my eyes--not because 
                         I was in the Mecca of whiskeys, if you were thinking that, but because they showed us this emotional documentary
                          they screened prior to the tour of the distillery. From all these visits, I picked up a few tricks to do with gauging
                           whiskey quality. But I wouldn't call myself an expert.
                </p>  

                <p style="font-family:Cambria;font-size:1.3vw;text-align: justify;">
                        <strong>What's your philosophy in life?</strong><br>
                        I don't follow any philosophy in life, as such. I just want to live life freely. I am very content 
                        with what life has given me, and I have never wanted more. I am not an ambitious person, unlike with most 
                        people in the world we live in. The world we live in today is such a strange place--so full of judgement, 
                        prejudice and hate. And everyone lives behind different facades--never saying things they actually think. 
                        I wish everyone would be free of everything that constrains their minds, and not live behind facades--but
                         be open and transparent.
