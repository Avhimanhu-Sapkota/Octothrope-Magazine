                        Summer is one of the busiest travel seasons of the year, which means going a vacation during this time takes a little 
                        extra planning. Before taking a trip, you need to think about what destinations aren't going to be overly crowded, 
                        too hot, or super expensive, since airfare costs often spike during summer months. With so many factors to consider 
                        when planning a summer vacation, we turned to travel influencers to see where they recommend going this June.<br><br>
                        Ahead, you'll find seven June destination recommendations. These influencers suggest both domestic and international 
                        locations, so you can decide what works best for your travel goals and budgets. They've also provided tips for where
                         to stay, which sites to see, and what to eat in order to kick off the summer travel season the right way.

                <h4>Malaysia</h4>
                
                <p style="font-family:Cambria;font-size:1.3vw;text-align: justify;">
                        "Malaysia is a great place to visit for many reasons. First of all, there's something for everyone. If you prefer a big city
                         vibe, keep Kuala Lumpur in mind. From skyscrapers to mega-malls, KL has much to offer. Including street markets reminiscent
                          of Thailand and bat cave adventures.
                        <br><br>
                        If you're a little bit country, head to the Cameron Highlands. Known for its tea, trekking, and temples. Soak up some sun and 
                        do a bit of island hopping (Tioman or Langkawi) or check out the UNESCO World Heritage site of Penang.
                        <br><br>
                        Penang is one of my personal favourite destinations. There's so much colour and culture in this historic city. Indian,
                         Chinese, and Malay people make up a majority of the population. Which is evident in the food, architecture, and traditions.
                          Be sure to try the nutmeg juice, it's a delicious and unique flavour that you must try in Penang." 
                </p>

                <h4>Quebec City, Canada</h4>
                
                <p style="font-family:Cambria;font-size:1.3vw;text-align: justify;">
                    "Although Canada is known for its cold winters, come springtime Canada is marvellous. June makes the perfect time to visit
                     the beautiful Quebec City. Filled with charm, Old Quebec has the feel of cottage country. If you're looking for an escape
                      from the busy city, you'll be in awe of QC.
                    <br><br>
                    Firstly, this is the home of poutine. You'll find countless restaurants that specialise in various forms of this delicious 
                    treat. Quebec is also known for its maple syrup and wine. A perfect day is walking from shop to shop tasting all these delicacies.
                    <br><br>
                    If you feel fancy, you can stay at the Fairmount Le Chateau Frontenac, which is an actual castle. If you are into history,
                     you will love the stunning architecture. Take advantage of daily walking tours to learn about the history of Quebec City
                      and brush up on your French. You don't need a car because you can walk everywhere inside the Walled City, or even take a 
                      horse and carriage ride. It is the ultimate relaxing getaway."

                <h4>Sun Valley, Idaho</h4>
                
                <p style="font-family:Cambria;font-size:1.3vw;text-align: justify;">
                        "Mountains beckon and adventure awaits in the stunning Sun Valley, Idaho. Forever a favourite with the Hollywood Elite,
                         this mountain town has a peaceful presence where visitors can take a digital detox and enjoy the sound of silence. 
                         While it's known as 'America's First Destination Ski Resort,' Sun Valley truly shines in the month of June â€” and with 
                         200 days of sunshine a year, I truly mean shines.
                        <br><br>
                        Visitors to Sun Valley should stay at the famed Sun Valley Lodge and dine at local favourite restaurants such as The Ram,
                         Gretchen's, and Grumpy's. With its infinite adventures, visitors to Sun Valley can go hiking on the Proctor Mountain Loop,
                          mountain biking on Curly's Loop, horseback riding at the Sun Valley Stables, and you can even go ice skating all year round
                           at the Sun Valley Lodge. If you're feeling extra audacious, head to the top of Bald Mountain aka "Baldy," where you can 
                           paraglide from 9,000 feet of altitude with Fly Sun Valley! After a full day of adventures, seek out some of the healing 
                           hot springs in the Sun Valley area to soothe your muscles and your soul.
                        <br><br>
                        With direct flights from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Seattle, Denver, Portland, and Salt Lake City, Sun Valley
                         is easily accessible from many parts of the United States."

                                "Before the dreaded humidity of the late summer starts to set in, visiting New York City in June proves to
                                 be the best month weather-wise. Along with the sunshine comes the city starting to celebrate the warmer temperatures,
                                  so getting outside and walking around will create the perfect trip.
                                <br><br>
                                Shakespeare in the Park starts around this time of year, so you can get your Bard on for free at Central Park.
                                 The Mermaid Parade on Coney Island shows off a colourful cast of characters that will bring you joy. At the end

                                <br><br>
                                One of my favourite parts of the city is the Chinatown and Soho neighbourhoods, where you can find some of the best 
                                and most Instagrammable food shops, so don't miss out on pink restaurants, intricate latte art, cereal infused ice cream,

                                "Ah, Florence. I'd recommend visiting this stunning Tuscan heritage city in June. The summer weather jumps to 30 degrees celsius,
                                 and the entire city feels like an open-air museum, with world-famous art and Renaissance architecture on every corner.
                                  Spend your days wandering medieval cobbled alleys and museums, watching local artists paint watercolours on the Ponte
                                   Vecchio, window-shopping at jewellery boutiques, and inhaling the heady smell of Italian leather at the marketplace with
                                    a gelato in hand. By night, explore Florence's vibrant aperitivo bar culture and enjoy some of the finest Tuscan food in
                                     the region. The city was built for walking and discovering â€” perfect for a June weekend away."
